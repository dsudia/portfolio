        <div class="bodyText">
        <p>I'm Dave Sudia. I was born in Oakland, CA, and lived in various part of the Bay Area until I was 25. I got married pretty young, at 21, and in 2006, my wife Natalie and I decided to move out of the Bay Area due to the cost of living, to Phoenix, AZ. We were miserable there, but we both got our Master's degrees in Education. We moved away from Phoenix to Boulder and then onto Denver, where we currently live, in the West Highlands neighborhood.</p>
        <p>We welcomed a new addition to our family in September, Henry Sudia. He's an awesome little guy! Now we are 3 people, 3 cats and a dog. We have season tickets to the Colorado Shakespeare Festival and the Colorado Rapids soccer team. I love riding my bike around Denver, driving my Volkswagen GTI a bit faster than I should around corners, and skiing. Though hanging with my son has been my major hobby lately.</p>
