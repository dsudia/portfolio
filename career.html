        <p>I'm going to be a web developer! I'm very excited!</p>
        <p>My background is in education, specifically Special Education for students with intensive behavior support needs. In other words, my background is in helping people solve difficult problems, by analyzing complex systems and creating new paths within those systems to improve outcomes. That is why I think I will transition to this new field well.</p>
        <p>Most of my experience in this area is in front-end design work, and even that is primarily in writing copy, rather than the graphic design aspect. I know my way around basic HTML, and finding out about CSS was incredible! What a time saver! Since I have so little exposure to back-end work, I'm not sure what my interest level will be there. Ideally, I'd like to move into some sort of system analysis/design role, as that big picture thinking is where my strength is.</p>
        <p>I'm looking forward to meeting everyone in the course!</p>
